# quickpdfjoin
Quick PDF Join is a cross-platform, simple application that joins multiple PDF files together.

It is written in C#, and targets .NET 8 on Linux and Windows. It relies on [Avalonia](https://github.com/AvaloniaUI/Avalonia), as its UI framework, and on [itext-dotnet](https://github.com/itext/itext-dotnet/), as its PDF editing library.

Features:
* adding, removing and clearing of input PDF files
* multi-selection, when adding PDF files
* joining of differently structured PDF files
* automatic compression of the output PDF file
